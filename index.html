		<h2>About this Site</h2>
		<p class="subtitle">Here's some information for you, Heather!  Click the questions to reveal the answers.</p>
		<div class="QA">
			<p class="question">What is this site?</p>
			<p class="answer">This site is a prototype site that will allow learners to see available L&D badges at my company, learn how to earn badges, and see which badges they have already earned.  This site will become a page in my company's internal Sharepoint site.  As you do not have access to our internal site, I made this page a standalone on Github so you can see it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="QA">
			<p class="question">Who made this site and in what program?</p>
			<p class="answer">This site was entirely hand-coded by myself (Rebeccca) from scratch including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery.  I have a backgroud in web design from both my undergrad and my professional life.  The program was in Notepad ++ because it's what I was most comfortable with back in my web design days.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="QA">
			<p class="question">How does it know the person viewing it earned specific badges?</p>
			<p class="answer">At the moment, the functionality for the site to actually detect and track each user's progress in earning badges is not present.  This requires a much higher level of coding including SQL, Python, and heavy use of APIs through both Skilljar, Microsoft Teams, and more.  Conveniently, this is my husband's wheelhouse so he has verified that it is possible and I can produce scripts and a Tableau dashboard that shows that the data is able to be successfully retrieved from Skilljar as an example.  I won't unless you require it because it might be more technical than you need to judge the project.  However this is a very large effort and we are still in talks about timing and compensation.  This project is a real, living thing that will continue after LDT 505 is over.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="QA">
			<p class="question">Why does it think I earned some badges and not others?</p>
			<p class="answer">For now, I have awarded you some badges so you can see what it'll look like when we have all of the functionality described in the previous qustion completed.  To prove this site can be updated per user, your badge awards aren't hard-coded into the site.  Instead, the list is in a <a href="https://rebecca-lynch.github.io/LDT505/practice_info.txt" target="_blank">.txt file</a> this site is pulling from.  Eventually, it will pull from an SQL server (which is within our capabilities as well!)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="QA">
			<p class="question">Why is the information on this page about the class?</p>
			<p class="answer">The information on this page will be replaced to describe the site to learners without discussing the Penn State course that started it.  But I thought the functionality could be communicated here while still keeping the information helpful to the instructor reviewing it (Hello, Heather!  I hope you like my site!)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="QA">
			<p class="question">Why this style for the site and badges?</p>
			<p class="answer">This site and all graphics in it are using official company colors, images, and icons.  The style also reflects the style of the <a href="https://www.pointb.com/" target="_blank">company's website.</a></p>
		</div>
		<div class="QA">
			<p class="question">The links don't work!</p>
			<p class="answer">Sorry, they will lead to our company's Skilljar portal, which does not allow guest users.  I can send screenshots, if needed!  Skilljar is mobile-friendly.</a></p>
